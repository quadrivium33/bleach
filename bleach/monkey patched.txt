We want to allow iframes for embedding videos from youtube/vimeo and other 
sites but definitely do not want iframes for any other reason. This is not 
straighforward because bleach has no support for optionally allowing tags 
based on attributes, in this case netloc host matching. 

Bleach provides it's own sanitizer on top of html5lib and we want what it 
provides but need to add custom logic to support iframe testing. 

Hence SMBleachSanitizerMixin. In order to get it into the inheritance 
chain of the top level bleach functions, monkey patching the bleach
library was nessasary. 

All other solutions also required modifying key bleach inheritance
chains anyway, so this is the most straightforward solution.
